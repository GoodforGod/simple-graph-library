Simple Graph Library as test assigment.

## Task
Simple Graph lib: 
- Should support 2 types of graphs - directed and undirected with 3 operations:
- addVertex - adds vertex to the graph
- addEdge - adds edge to the graph
- getPath - returns a list of edges between 2 vertices (path doesn’t have to be optimal)
- Vertices should be of a user defined type.

Questions to be ready to answer (don’t have to implement):
- Add weighted edges support in your lib.
- Add traverse function that will take a user defined function and apply it on every vertex of the graph.
- Make your graphs thread safe.
